# Overview

I have created a Task Manager app to go along with my recent Kotlin project. It has the same functionality as the most recent project and allows the user to create tasks, edit the task list, and track their progress.

# Development Environment

-I based my app off my previous Kotlin code. I used Android Studio to create my app.
